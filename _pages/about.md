Short Bio
=========

I am a research officer at RTE (Réseau de Transport d'Électricité) Research & Development.
I mainly work on designing an AI algorithm to advise power grid operators on the best actions.

I graduated from the École polytechnique (X2013) and Stanford University (MSc in Civil & Environmental Engineering).
I obtained a PhD in Computer Science at Université Paris-Saclay and RTE R&D under the supervision of Isabelle Guyon, Marc Schoenauer, and Rémy Clément.
I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Institut Montefiore (Université de Liège) with Louis Wehenkel.

I have a strong interest in the Energy domain and its environmental and societal implications, as well as in Artificial Intelligence, more specifically, Graph Neural Networks.
My focus is on real-life and real-time Power Systems applications.
