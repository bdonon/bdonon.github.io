Balthazar Donon is a postdoctoral researcher at Institut Montefiore (Université de Liège) and RTE Research and Development.
He is working on the design of an AI algorithm that will advise power grid operators on the best actions to take.

He graduated from the École polytechnique (X2013) and from Stanford University (MSc in Civil & Environmental Engineering).
He then obtained a PhD in Computer Science at Université Paris-Saclay and RTE R&D under the supervision of Isabelle Guyon, Marc Schoenauer and Rémy Clément. 

He has a strong interest in the Energy domain and its environmental and societal implications, as well in Artificial Intelligence, more specifically Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. He aims at developing novel artificial neural network algorithms targeted at real-life and real-time Power Systems applications.
